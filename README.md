## 🛠️ Repository Structure

🤞Welcome to the presentation of Binfinity, an innovative app designed to enhance medical sanitation through cutting-edge technology. Here, we’ll guide you through our app’s seamless navigation and its remarkable features.

## Step-1 loginpage.html

We begin with the Login Page, where users can either sign in or create a new account. New users can easily register by entering their credentials, which are securely stored in a linked Google Sheet via our Node.js backend. Existing users can log in using their credentials, seamlessly transitioning to our dynamic dashboard.Here we have build the app using raw data.The login id: 'saveetha@gmail.com' and our password:123456.

## Step-2 newdashboard.html

Upon logging in, users are greeted by our neat and intuitive dashboard, which includes user reviews to enhance community engagement. We first navigate to the Sterilization Reports section. Here, users can view the current cycle status and an overview of previous reports. To facilitate user understanding, we’ve also integrated a comprehensive sterilization process flow.

## Step-3 productsservices.html

Next, we move to the Products and Services page. By clicking 'Explore,' users can delve into the products section, showcasing our state-of-the-art UV-C sanitation chamber and IoT devices. Each product card features a 'Learn More' option, providing in-depth descriptions to enrich user knowledge.

## Step-4 realtimemonitoring.html

Moving on to the Real-Time Monitoring page, users can analyze graphs depicting bin waste levels, complemented by an overall overview and notifications. A sample export data feature allows users to save and download data from these graphs in CSV format. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce a theme selection and a helpline feature, along with a key tagline emphasizing the science of IoT.

## Step-5 binsecond.html

Now, we move to the Waste Management page, where users can monitor bin levels in real time, ensuring efficient waste disposal. This section features visual analytical tools, such as graphs and charts, providing critical insights into waste generation patterns. These visuals enable optimized collection schedules and enhance operational efficiency. With comprehensive analytical reviews, users can track performance trends and leverage these tools to implement effective waste reduction strategies, ultimately promoting sustainability in their sanitation efforts.

## Step-6 medicine.html

Advancing to the Medicine Management page, users will find a unique scanner feature that enables them to scan medicine labels. This feature retrieves all pertinent information, including dosage and expiry details. However, as this idea is still in the innovation phase and not yet in active use, we currently do not have real-time datasets available. We have included a sample output page demonstrating what the recently scanned medicine data might look like.It is available in tablet.html page.

## Step-7 alerts.html

Finally, we have the Timely Alerts page, ensuring critical updates are always at your fingertips. Users can subscribe to receive timely notifications regarding sanitation processes.

## Step-8 Conclusion

Thank you for joining me on this journey through Binfinity. We are excited about the potential impact of our app in revolutionizing medical sanitation. For more information, please explore our website or reach out to our team. Together, let’s advance towards a safer, cleaner future.
